    At the foothills of the Himalayas lies the rural district of Jhanjharpur.
    Located on the banks of the River Kamala, this is a fertile region for agriculture. 
    Yet with little money for irrigation or equipment, life remains a daily struggle for the many small-scale farmers.
    Take Murali* for example. He wanted to expand his business with new seeds and a pond, but lacked the funds to do it. Like many others, he saw no option but to apply for a government agricultural subsidy.
    Yet instead of granting money, Murali says, the official demanded it – refusing to process the application unless Murali paid a bribe. Unable to pay, Murali left empty-handed. He returned many times,
    but nothing changed.
